# Getting Started with Create React App

1. npm i react-router react-router-dom


# Other routers

1. BrowserRouter - 99% of the time
2. HashRouter - puts # at end of url so that server can ignore last part of url if client has to use same url
3. unstable_HistoryRouter - allows you to use back and forward button.
4. MemoryRouter - url never changes, useful if you run tests w/o being on browser
5. StaticRouter - doesnt allow you to change location.
6. Nativerouter - for React Native
